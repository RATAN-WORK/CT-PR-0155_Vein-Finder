# Roadmap for Vein Detection in Thermal Images

## 1. Classical Image Processing Approach

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Denoise (Gaussian blur, median filter)
   - Enhance contrast (CLAHE, histogram equalization)
   - Normalize intensity

2. **Vein Enhancement**
   - Apply edge detection (Canny, Sobel)
   - Use morphological operations (opening, closing, top-hat)
   - Try adaptive/local thresholding

3. **Postprocessing**
   - Remove small artifacts (contour filtering)
   - Skeletonize or thin the vein structures

4. **Evaluation**
   - Visually inspect results
   - If you have ground truth, compute metrics (IoU, Dice)

## 2. Deep Learning (CNN) Approach

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect and annotate more images (vein masks)
   - Augment data (rotation, scaling, flipping)

2. **Model Selection**
   - Use segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLabV3, etc.)

3. **Training**
   - Split data (train/val/test)
   - Train model on annotated masks

4. **Inference**
   - Predict vein masks on new images
   - Postprocess (threshold, morphological ops)

5. **Evaluation**
   - Use metrics (IoU, Dice, accuracy)
   - Visualize overlays

### Recommendation

- Start with classical image processing for quick prototyping and understanding your data.
- If results are not satisfactory or you want higher accuracy, move to CNN-based segmentation (requires annotated data).
